          <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
          <p>
            "Peg de Volta" was a web application developed to provide clients with access to credits based on their FGTS
            (Guarantee Fund for Length of Service) during the challenging period of the pandemic. I contributed to the
            project as a front-end developer, focusing on bringing the product to completion. My responsibilities
            included finalizing layouts, creating missing pages, implementing user-friendly forms, setting up the email
            system, enhancing registration and login processes, and establishing a back-office environment. The project
            served as a valuable resource during the pandemic, although it is currently discontinued.

            "Peg de Volta" was successfully delivered and used to provide financial support to clients during the
            pandemic. However, it is currently discontinued. The project played a vital role in offering FGTS-based
            credits to those in need during a challenging time, contributing to financial stability and well-being.

            The "TalkProgress" is a dynamic platform designed to streamline
            internal processes, training programs, and employee management for external companies. The project combines
            completed and ongoing efforts, featuring a range of enhancements and new features. My role as a front-end
            developer involved implementing improvements such as knowledge tests and virtual training modules. The tech
            stack includes Backbone, CoffeeScript, React, Redux, with a MySQL-powered backend, and seamless integration
            with a mobile environment built in Flutter. I also played a crucial role in developing web pages for new
            company products.

                    Ensuring seamless navigation between different sections (characters, episodes, worlds) posed a UX

              management, and related tasks that contribute to the overall success of the endeavor.
